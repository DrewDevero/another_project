# pre-work-profile
Per Scholas, Software Engineering Course Pre-work "another_project."

This is Drew's Per Scholas Pre-work practice project for creating a git repo then pushing to github as opposed to cloning a github repo, adding files locally, then commiting them to my repo's main branch on github as was done with my "pre-work-profile" repo.
